Each map is a composite of LULC predictions for 9 classes throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of each year. This dataset was generated by Impact Observatory, who used billions of human-labeled pixels (curated by the National Geographic Society) to train a deep learning model for land classification. This map uses an updated model from the 10-class model and combines Grass(formerly class 3) and Scrub (formerly class 6) into a single Rangeland class (class 11). The original Esri 2020 Land Cover collection uses 10 classes (Grass and Scrub separate) and an older version of the underlying deep learning model. \n",

Here, \"forest\" is defined as the natural forest with the area larger than 0.5 ha and forest cover over 10%. This definition is the same as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) definition. Since the radar backscatter from the forest depends on the region (climate zone), the classification of Forest/Non-Forest is conducted by using a region-dependent threshold of backscatter. The classification accuracy is checked by using in-situ photos and high-resolution optical satellite images.\n",
